## About me...

### I love to work with computers to create stuff.

General interests:

1. Linux
2. Programming
3. Breaking and fixing things
4. Learning anything that challenges the way I think

### In regards to programming, I am mostly self taught.

I started coding before I took my first course in programming. The first class I took was in high school and it was based on Pascal. After the Pascal intro course, I took AP Computer Science my senior year. I attended the University of Pittsburgh where I pursued a degree in Information Science. I considered Computer Science, but it was the year `2000` and the `Information Age` was exploding because of the Internet. Nonetheless, I did not complete my degreee because I felt it was not worth the money.  

## I hope to let programming journey continue...
