# Commoditization of Information Technology 
[Go Home...](https://davidprush.com)

Commoditization of Information Technology is a double-edged sword because “it loses its uniqueness and competitive advantage.” 
Information technology can bring a competitive edge to businesses, but when that technology is commoditized, its availability
increases—inherently decreasing uniqueness—and becomes generic. Small to medium-sized businesses must decide which commoditized
technologies are essential to remaining relevant and judiciously select competitive technologies yet to be commoditized. 
The key is innovation and the unique technologies that either complement or deliver a competitive advantage. 
What technologies can the small to medium-sized businesses adopt for a competitive advantage?

Companies must decide which technologies maintain the status quo versus those that deliver a competitive advantage. 
Not long ago, the cloud was an innovative technology providing a competitive advantage—smaller businesses could not 
afford it—but now it is commoditized. The cloud is no longer unique, but it is now common for any sized organization
to use it, from data storage to web apps. However, smaller organizations may not know what technologies are commodities
used to remain relevant—maintaining the status quo—or which ones deliver true innovation for a competitive edge. 
For instance, a pizza shop requires an online ordering capability that vertically integrates with its point-of-sale
system; many “off-the-shelf” (commoditized) solutions exist. But the same pizza shop should not consider commoditized
products as innovative solutions that provide a competitive edge—for it is neither unique nor scarce. Commoditized 
solutions allow organizations to recognize what is necessary to remain relevant.

Nonetheless, the more difficult question remains: what innovative technologies bring a competitive edge over the competition? 
The answer requires differentiation from the competition and implementing technical solutions accordingly. If this were easy,
there would be many more Apples, Microsofts, and Teslas of the world, which incessantly innovate “to escape the commodity trap.”
But any organization should never trick itself into thinking a commodity is innovative, providing a unique competitive advantage.
