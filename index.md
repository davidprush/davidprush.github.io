## About me

I am a dedicated life-long learner with interests in Linux, programming, and technology. I believe the path I take is more important than the destination. It is in the moments of finding creative solutions to problems that I find my highest satisfaction and fulfillment. As a self-taught programming hobbyist this github.io page provides the best opportunity to share this process. Being a firm believer in altruism, I find open source software like Linux the pinnacle of advancing software technologies. I believe humanity is at its best when we openly share information and our innovations. 

### General interests:

1. Linux
2. Programming
3. Breaking and fixing things
4. Learning anything that challenges the way I think
